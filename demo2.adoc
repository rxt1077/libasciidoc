This is a demonstration of {library} {libasciidoc-version}.
And this is the preamble of this document.

[[purpose]]
.Purpose
****
This document exercises many of the features of AsciiDoc to test the {library} implementation.
****

TIP: If you want the HTML to have the familiar AsciiDoc Python style, load the asciidoc.css stylesheet using the CLI option `-a stylesheet=asciidoc.css`.

== First Steps with AsciiDoc

.Inline markup
* underlines around a phrase place _emphasis_
* astericks around a phrase make the text *bold*
* double astericks around one or more **l**etters in a word make those letters bold
* double underscore around a __sub__string in a word emphasizes that substring
* use carrots around characters to make them ^super^script
* use tildes around characters to make them ~sub~script
ifdef::basebackend-html[* to pass through +++<b>HTML</b>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus]
ifdef::basebackend-docbook[* to pass through +++<constant>XML</constant>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus]

// separate two adjacent lists using a line comment (only the leading // is required)

- characters can be escaped using a {backslash}
* for instance, you can escape a quote inside emphasized text like _Here\'s Johnny!_
- you can safely use reserved XML characters like <, > and &, which are escaped when converting
- force a space{sp}between inline elements using the \{sp} attribute
- hold text together with an intrinsic non-breaking{nbsp}space attribute, \{nbsp}
- handle words with unicode characters like in the name Gregory RomÃ©
- claim your copyright (C), registered trademark (R) or trademark (TM)
- select menu:View[Zoom > Reset] to reset the zoom

////

You can write text http://example.com[with inline links], optionally{sp}using
an explicit link:http://example.com[link prefix]. In either case, the link can
have a http://example.com?foo=bar&lang=en[query string].

If you want to break a line +
just end it in a {plus} sign +
and continue typing on the next line.

=== Lists Upon Lists

.Adjacent lists
* this list
* should join

* to have
* four items
